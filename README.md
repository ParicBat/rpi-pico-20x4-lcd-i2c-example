# rpi-pico-20x4-lcd-i2c-example
20 x 4 LCD I2C Display example for Raspberry Pi Pico\
I used the `lcd_1602_i2c` example for the source code, you can find it [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/i2c/lcd_1602_i2c).

# Compiling
1. If you don't have PICO_SDK_PATH defined already, uncomment the `export PICO_SDK_PATH=PATH/TO/PICO-SDK` line in the compile.sh file and change the value to the path to your `pico-sdk` folder.
2. Run the compile.sh script
